strip_tags() vs htmlspecialchars()

1. strip_tags():
- This function removes all HTML and PHP tags from the user input.
- It is useful for filtering out unwanted HTML elements, especially in cases where the content should not contain any HTML.
- It does not provide protection against special characters like '<', '>', etc. (e.g., <script> tags).

2. htmlspecialchars():
- This function converts special characters into HTML entities (e.g., '<' becomes '&lt;').
- It is more appropriate when you want to prevent XSS attacks while still allowing the user to input HTML special characters safely (without being interpreted as code).
- It doesn't remove HTML tags but ensures that they are treated as plain text.

In summary:
- `strip_tags()` strips out all HTML tags.
- `htmlspecialchars()` encodes special characters, preventing HTML tags from being executed.
